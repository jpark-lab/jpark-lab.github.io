                            Jiwoon Park, Ph.D. is a Postdoc at Weill Cornell Medicine and the founder of the Spatial Atlas of Human Anatomy (SAHA), an initiative to create the largest high-resolution, multi-omic maps of human organs. Her research bridges experimental and computational biology, integrating engineered organ models, spatial multi-omics, and AI to decode how cellular microenvironments drive health, disease progression, and therapeutic responses.
                            <br><br>
                            She develops both experimental and computational platforms for high-plex spatial profiling (spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and imaging) and their integration with genomic, proteomic, and clinical datasets. She is particularly interested in how organ systems respond to genetic and environmental risk factors over time, and how these processes vary across individuals, tissues, and disease states—ranging from cancer to immune-mediated diseases.
                            <br><br>
                            During her Ph.D. at Cornell University and The Rockefeller University under Christopher Mason and Charles Rice, she developed the stem cell–derived multicellular liver model to study the PNPLA3 genetic variant, uncovering a novel injury-responsive stellate cell subtype with “epigenetic memory” that accelerates fibrosis.
